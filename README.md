franky is a high-level control library for Franka robots, offering Python and C++ support.
By providing a high-level control interface, franky eliminates the need for strict real-time programming at 1 kHz,
making control from non-real-time environments, such as Python programs, feasible.
Instead of relying on low-level control commands, franky expects high-level position or velocity targets and
uses [Ruckig](https://github.com/pantor/ruckig) to plan time-optimal trajectories in real-time.

Although Python does not provide real-time guarantees, franky strives to maintain as much real-time control as possible.
Motions can be preempted at any moment, prompting franky to re-plan trajectories on the fly.
To handle unforeseen situations—such as unexpected contact with the environment — franky includes a reaction system that
allows for updating motion commands dynamically.
Furthermore, most non-real-time functionality of [libfranka](https://frankarobotics.github.io/docs/doc/libfranka/docs/index.html), such as
Gripper control is made directly available in Python.

Check out the [documentation](https://timschneider42.github.io/franky/) and
the [examples](https://github.com/TimSchneider42/franky/tree/master/examples) for an introduction.

If you do not have a robot at hand, you can also try
the [simulation](https://timschneider42.github.io/franky/guide/simulation.html) first.

## 🚀 Features

- **Control your Franka robot directly from Python in just a few lines!**
  No more endless hours setting up ROS, juggling packages, or untangling dependencies. Just `pip install` — no ROS at all.

- **[Trajectory control](https://timschneider42.github.io/franky/guide/trajectory-control.html)**: [Cartesian position](https://timschneider42.github.io/franky/guide/trajectory-control.html#cartesian-position-control), [Cartesian velocity](https://timschneider42.github.io/franky/guide/trajectory-control.html#cartesian-velocity-control), [Joint position](https://timschneider42.github.io/franky/guide/trajectory-control.html#joint-position-control), and [Joint velocity](https://timschneider42.github.io/franky/guide/trajectory-control.html#joint-velocity-control) control.
  franky's trajectory controllers use [Ruckig](https://github.com/pantor/ruckig) to generate smooth, time-optimal trajectories while respecting velocity, acceleration, and jerk limits.

- **[Analytical kinematics](https://timschneider42.github.io/franky/guide/kinematics.html)**: Compute forward kinematics and solve inverse kinematics offline, with nearest-branch tracking.

- **[Torque control](https://timschneider42.github.io/franky/guide/torque-control.html)**: [Direct torque control](https://timschneider42.github.io/franky/guide/torque-control.html) and [Impedance control](https://timschneider42.github.io/franky/guide/impedance-control.html).
  Command joint torques directly, or use franky's built-in [Cartesian](https://timschneider42.github.io/franky/guide/impedance-control.html#cartesian-impedance-control) and [joint](https://timschneider42.github.io/franky/guide/impedance-control.html#joint-impedance-control) impedance controllers.

- **[Real-time control from Python and C++](https://timschneider42.github.io/franky/guide/realtime-motions.html)**
  Need to change the target while the robot’s moving? No problem. franky replans trajectories on the fly so that you can preempt motions anytime.

- **[Reactive behavior](https://timschneider42.github.io/franky/guide/reactions.html)**
  Robots don’t always go according to plan. franky lets you define reactions to unexpected events—like contact with the environment — so you can change course in real-time.

- **[Motion and reaction callbacks](https://timschneider42.github.io/franky/guide/executing-motions.html#motion-callbacks)**
  Want to monitor what’s happening under the hood? Add callbacks to your motions and reactions. They won’t block the control thread and are super handy for debugging or logging.

- **Things are moving too fast? [Tune the robot's dynamics to your needs](https://timschneider42.github.io/franky/guide/robot.html)**
  Adjust max velocity, acceleration, and jerk to match your setup or task. Fine control for smooth, safe operation.

- **Full Python access to the libfranka API**
  Want to tweak impedance, read the robot state, set force thresholds, or mess with the Jacobian? Go for it. If libfranka supports it, chances are franky does, too.

- **Scared to test code on the real system?**: **[franky-sim](https://github.com/TimSchneider42/franky-sim) provides [simulator support](https://timschneider42.github.io/franky/guide/simulation.html) for franky**! It is easy to install and use and serves as a drop-in replacement for the real robot.

## 📖 Python Quickstart Guide

Real-time kernel already installed and real-time permissions granted? Just install franky via

```bash
pip install franky-control
```

Otherwise, follow the [installation instructions](https://timschneider42.github.io/franky/getting-started/installation.html) first.

We also provide development builds of the latest `master` (stable) and `dev` (unstable) branches:

```bash
# Replace 10 with your robot server version
# Development (stable): latest master branch
pip install --pre franky-control --extra-index-url "https://timschneider42.github.io/franky/whl/by-robot-server-version/10/"
# Development (unstable): latest dev branch
pip install --pre franky-control --extra-index-url "https://timschneider42.github.io/franky/branches/dev/whl/by-robot-server-version/10/"
```

Now we are already ready to go!
Unlock the brakes in the web interface, activate FCI, and start coding:

```python
from franky import *

robot = Robot("10.90.90.1")  # Replace this with your robot's IP

# Let's start slow (this lets the robot use a maximum of 5% of its velocity, acceleration, and jerk limits)
robot.relative_dynamics_factor = 0.05

# Move the robot 20cm along the relative X-axis of its end-effector
motion = CartesianMotion(Affine([0.2, 0.0, 0.0]), ReferenceType.Relative)
robot.move(motion)
```

If you are seeing server version mismatch errors, your robot is likely running an older firmware or is an older Franka
Panda model — see
the [FAQ](https://timschneider42.github.io/franky/getting-started/faq.html#i-am-seeing-server-version-mismatch-errors-what-now)
for how to install matching wheels.
